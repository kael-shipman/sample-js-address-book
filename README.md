Sample JS Address Book
==============================================================================================

This is a very small in-memory address book application designed to compare and contrast programming techniques between javascript and other languages (Haskell, in the immediate use-case).

It is not meant to serve any real purpose other than to demonstrate the way you might do certain things in native javascript.

Run by typing `./src/address-book` from the repo root.
